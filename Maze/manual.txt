Description:
You control a green character who spawns outside of a maze. Move with WASD.
Your objective is to get to the center of the maze and claim a green ball.
The ball is guarded by red enemies, and as you get closer to the center, they get more and more packed.
Lucikly, the enemies aren't very smart: their movement is quite random and you just have to be quick and plan your way to the center.
Be careful though, once you collide with the enemy, the game is over.
